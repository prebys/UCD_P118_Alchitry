2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net c1/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin c1/mem_reg[15][7]_i_2/O, cell c1/mem_reg[15][7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net c1/nibble_reg[3][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin c1/mem_reg[14][7]_i_1/O, cell c1/mem_reg[14][7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net c1/nibble_reg[3]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin c1/mem_reg[13][7]_i_1/O, cell c1/mem_reg[13][7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
